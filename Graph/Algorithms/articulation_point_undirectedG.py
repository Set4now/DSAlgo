"""

A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) if removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components. They are useful for designing reliable networks. 

For a disconnected undirected graph, 
an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.

Naive Approach: A simple approach is to one by one remove all vertices and see if removal of a vertex causes disconnected graph. Following are steps of simple approach for connected graph.

For every vertex v, do following:

Remove v from graph 
See if the graph remains connected (We can either use BFS or DFS) 
Add v back to the graph
Time Complexity: O(V*(V+E)) for a graph represented using adjacency list.





Efficient Approach (Using DFS) using Tarjans Algorith concept: 
The idea is to use DFS (Depth First Search). 


In DFS, we follow vertices in tree form called DFS tree. 
In DFS tree, a vertex u is parent of another vertex v, if v is discovered by u (obviously v is an adjacent of u in graph). 

In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true. 

u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children. 
u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u.
