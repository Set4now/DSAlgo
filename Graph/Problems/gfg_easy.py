'''
Given a directed graph. 
The task is to do Breadth First Traversal of this graph starting from 0.

Note: One can move from node u to node v only if there's an edge from u to v and 
find the BFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex, 
from left to right according to the graph. 

Also, you should only take nodes directly or indirectly connected from Node 0 in consideration.

        Using a DFS approach

        1. Create an ajacency list dict from the input graph
        where key is vertex and value is list of edges
        
        eg. 

        input graph:-
        [
            [1, 0, 1, 0],
            [1, 1, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 1, 0],
            [0, 1, 0, 1]
        ]
        
        ajacency list dict will be {0: [2], 1: [0], 3: [1]}
        NOTE: a vertex to itself is always 1, we are considering it's own path is always 1 (reachble) 
        this already 1 as you can see in the input graph

        G[0][0] = 1, G[1][1] = 1.... means the diagonal is always 1

        see create_adjacentlist()

        2. Now use a DFS appoach
        for every node in ajacency list dict
            consider it as parent root node
            all its edges as child
            so connectivity matrix (result) will have

            connectivity_matrix[parent][child] = 1

            also, the parent will be same for the nested childs of current child as well

            eg A --> B --> C --> D

            here, A is parent, its child is B
            B' child is C
            C' child is D

            So, keep updating the result connectivity_matrix[parent][allchilds] = 1
            [A][B] = 1, 
            [A][C] = 1
            [A][D] = 1
